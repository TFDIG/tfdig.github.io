# Autumn 2023

The study group meets approximately every other Wednesday, from 14:00 to 16:00.

## 13. September
First meeting of the term. In this meeting, we will start exploring tools and methods for data visualisation. If you are interested in browsing some tools and resources in advance of the meeting, I recommend the Digital Scholarship Center's [Visualization](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/research-methods/visualization/) pages.
