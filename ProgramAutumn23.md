# Autumn 2023

The study group meets approximately every other Wednesday, from 14:15 to 16:00.

## 13. September
First meeting of the term. In this meeting, we will start exploring tools and methods for data visualisation. If you are interested in browsing some tools and resources in advance of the meeting, I recommend the Digital Scholarship Center's [Visualization](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/research-methods/visualization/) pages.

## 27. September
Meeting cancelled due to illness.

## 11. October
Topic: Python for our research fields: Text mining/Digital text analysis and Data Visualization
<br>
Schedule: First, we go through a Python script made for visualizing a simple data set from a csv. file using the plotting library Matplotlib, and look at some examples of what we can do with Python that is relevant for our research fields. 
Then we start following a Python beginner's workshop.
